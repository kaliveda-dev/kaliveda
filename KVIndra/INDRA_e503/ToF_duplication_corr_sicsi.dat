# Time of Flight correction parameters (Silicon:CaesiumIodide) 
# for mass:charge duplication (in ns). 
# Any VAMOS nucleus with (RealZ, RealAoQ) inside the cuts defined in
# the 'duplication_aoq_cuts_sicsi.dat' will have their ToF modified by the
# values in this file.
#
# For the moment we don't know if IonisationChamber:Silicon ToF corrections 
# parameters are different so we have created two separated files.
#
# The format of this file is designed so that it can be easily read by the
# KVIVDB_e503 parser in a generic way. By doing this we avoid having to define a
# separate method to read each file as the format is now regulated. 
#
# Any field can be made a parameter by prefixing it like this: 
#     +parameter: some_name = value. 
#
# Beware that the parameter will be converted to a Double_t and that 'some_name'
# is optional and is not used in the program, it is used purely to convey to the
# human reader what the value of that parameter is.  Parameters will be added in
# the order they are specified. 
#
# Any line without a +something will be ignored by the parser. 
#
# WARNING: If you change the record_ids then you will also need to change the
# hard-coded values in KVIVUpDater_e503.
